# Bookshelf Project

## Bookshelf is small online solution for sorting books you are reading, want to or have read. Created with React.js

### Features:

### Search for new books by title or authors.

### Rearrange books within "reading", "want to read" and "read" bookshelfs

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.
